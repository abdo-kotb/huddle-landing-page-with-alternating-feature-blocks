## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Normalize
- Font Awesome library
- Autoprefixer
- Google fonts

### What I learned

I learned `filter` property and its effects for the first time in order to turn the logo color into white.
```css
footer .logo img {
  -webkit-filter: brightness(0) invert(1);
  filter: brightness(0) invert(1);
}
```

### Useful resources

- [The `filter` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter) - This artice helped me understand the `filter` fuction very well.
- [Autoprefixer](autoprefixer.github.io) - A great tool to automatically add the needed prefixes for different browsers.
